<h3>Guidelines and Instructions</h3>
<p>
	You are quite free in designing the T-Shirt. However, here is a list of constraints or suggestions that you should take into
	consideration:
	<ul>

		<li>The T-Shirt is two-sided. The design must show both the front and the back of the T-Shirt if you plan to submit a two-sided
			T-Shirt. However, it is not mandatory and you can submit a one-sided design.</li>

		<li>Four mandatory elements must be in the design: the VIS logo
			(<a href="img/vis2020_logo.png" target="_blank">jpg</a>, <a href="img/vis_logo.svg" target="_blank">svg</a>), a mention of the year &quot;<span class="config_year">2020</span>,&quot; a mention of the location &quot;<span class="config_location">Berlin</span>,&quot; and a mention of &quot;Student
			Volunteer&quot; &quot;SV&quot; or similar.</li>
		<li>The T-Shirt color should be noticeable, i.e. no black or white. You are free to pick any color for the T-Shirt.</li>
		<li>Colors for images are limited: you can use up to four different colors for the front, and up to four colors for the back.
			They do not have to be the same.</li>
		<li>The design cannot extend to the seams (side or top) or use the sleeves. Our printer provides a standard rectangular area
			that stops several inches from the seams.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
