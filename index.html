<p>
	This year, student volunteers will provide essential support to the IEEE VIS Conference remotely. 
	We are looking for reliable and enthusiastic students who have experience with online events to staff various virtual
	conference events or help with pre-conference setup to ensure a pleasant overall experience.
</p>

<p>
	Student volunteers will receive all of the benefits of this yearâ€™s program and get access to
	reserved virtual groups (more on this soon!). Student Volunteers will also benefit by observing
	first-hand the latest advances in visualization, hearing and meeting world-class as well as
	next-generation visualization professionals from around the world, and building a network of research colleagues.
</p>
