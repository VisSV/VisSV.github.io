<h3>I did not receive a notification. What to do?</h3>

<p>Sometimes we experience issues with the email notifications. If a deadline has passed and you did not receive any notification:
	first, check your spam folder; if nothing there, contact us to get your notification.</p>


<h3>I had to register before receiving the notification and have been selected to be a SV. Can I get reimbursed for the conference
	fee?</h3>

<p>Students that have already paid that have become student volunteers can be reimbursed the difference in registration fees.</p>


<h3>I do not want the SV accommodation. Can I get funding for my own accommodation?</h3>

<p>Every year there are some students that have housing locally, and/or who are coming with their family or sharing a place
	with other people from their lab. In that case, the SV still have to pay the SV registration fee (approx. $130), but after
	the conference you will be reimbursed the registration fee. There is no other reimbursement.</p>


<h3>Will I pay more than the registration fee?</h3>

<p>The SV registration fee covers the housing. The conference is free, and the housing is a very interesting rate. However,
	some years the housing is either cheaper or more expensive than planned, we only know that at the end of the conference.
	As a result, you will either be reimbursed the difference or have to pay the difference, at the end of the conference. Usually,
	these are relatively small amounts (less than $100)</p>
